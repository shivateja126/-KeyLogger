Introduction
A keylogger (short for keystroke logger) is a tool that records the keys pressed on a keyboard. Depending on how it is implemented, it can log simple keystrokes, capture clipboard data, take screenshots, or even track internet activity.

While the term "keylogger" is often linked with malicious intent, it is important to understand that the same technology can also serve legitimate purposes. 

For example:
In organizations, employers sometimes monitor employee devices for security compliance.
In research, keyloggers are studied to understand cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Parents may use monitoring software to protect children online.
This project demonstrates how such software works, purely for learning and awareness.



Types of Keyloggers

1. Software-Based Keyloggers

Software keyloggers are programs that run on the operating system. 
Their abilities may include:

Recording keystrokes typed by the user.

Capturing clipboard contents whenever data is copied.

Taking screenshots of the user’s screen.

Tracking web activity such as search queries, chats, or downloads.

These keyloggers can be hidden in the background and often disguise themselves as normal processes.

2. Hardware-Based Keyloggers

These are physical devices placed between the keyboard and the computer. 
Features include:

Work immediately when the system is turned on (no software needed).

It cannot usually be detected by antivirus software.

Storage capacity can vary from a few KB to several GB/TB, depending on the model.

Because they operate outside the operating system, they are often considered more difficult to detect.




Detecting and Removing Keyloggers

Keyloggers are designed to stay hidden, but some signs may include:

A delay between typing and the text appearing on the screen.

Mouse lag or unresponsive applications.

Unusual error messages or graphics glitches.

Decrease in browsing speed or sudden crashes.




To defend against them

Use antivirus/anti-malware tools capable of detecting hidden processes.

Scan regularly with heuristic analysis tools that detect suspicious behavior.

Watch for unknown hardware devices connected to your computer.




Preventive Measures

Here are some safe practices to reduce the risk of being affected by a keylogger:

Keep systems updated – Install security patches for your OS and applications.

Be cautious with downloads – Avoid installing unknown or pirated software.

Check email attachments – Do not open files from untrusted or unexpected sources.

Use strong passwords – Make them long, unique, and change them regularly.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) – Adds an extra layer of protection even if a password is stolen.
 Ethical Use & Awareness

It is important to highlight that keyloggers can be used both ethically and unethically.

Ethical use includes testing, learning, parental monitoring, and corporate security policies.

Unethical use involves stealing information, spying, or unauthorized surveillance, which is illegal and punishable under the law.

This project is strictly for educational purposes to help understand how attackers exploit such tools and how users can protect themselves.



Learning Objectives of This Project

By studying this project, you will:

Understand how keylogging technology works.

Learn the difference between software and hardware implementations.

Recognize common signs of infection.

Explore defensive strategies to secure your devices.

Gain awareness of the legal and ethical aspects of monitoring tools.
