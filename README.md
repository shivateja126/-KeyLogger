# **Advanced Keylogger**



---

## **🔹 Introduction**

A **keylogger** (short for keystroke logger) is a tool that records the keys pressed on a keyboard. Depending on how it is implemented, it can:

- Log simple keystrokes  
- Capture clipboard data  
- Take screenshots  
- Track internet activity  

> ⚠️ While the term keylogger is often linked with malicious intent, it is important to note that the same technology can also serve legitimate purposes, such as:

- **Organizational Use:** Employers may monitor employee devices for security compliance.
- **Research & Education:** Keyloggers are studied to understand cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
- **Parental Monitoring:** Parents may use monitoring software to protect children online.

This project demonstrates how such software works, purely for learning and awareness.

## **🔹 Types of Keyloggers**

### **1. Software-Based Keyloggers**

These are programs that run on the operating system. Their abilities may include:

- Recording keystrokes typed by the user  
- Capturing clipboard contents whenever data is copied  
- Taking screenshots of the user’s screen  
- Tracking web activity such as search queries, chats, or downloads  

> They can run in the background and often disguise themselves as normal processes.

### **2. Hardware-Based Keyloggers**

These are physical devices placed between the keyboard and the computer. Key features:

- Work immediately when the system is turned on (no software needed)  
- Cannot usually be detected by antivirus software  
- Storage capacity ranges from a few KB to several GB/TB, depending on the model  
- Operate outside the operating system, making them harder to detect

## **🔹 Detecting and Removing Keyloggers**

**Possible signs of infection include:**

- Delay between typing and text appearing on the screen  
- Mouse lag or unresponsive applications  
- Unusual error messages or graphics glitches  
- Decrease in browsing speed or sudden crashes  

**Defensive measures:**

- Use antivirus/anti-malware tools capable of detecting hidden processes  
- Run regular scans with heuristic analysis tools  
- Monitor unknown hardware devices connected to your system

## **🔹 Preventive Measures**

To reduce the risk of being affected by a keylogger:

- 🔒 **Keep systems updated:** Install OS and application patches regularly  
- 📥 **Be cautious with downloads:** Avoid pirated or unknown software  
- 📧 **Check email attachments:** Don’t open suspicious files  
- 🔑 **Use strong passwords:** Long, unique, and changed frequently  
- 🔐 **Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):** Adds an extra layer of protection

## **🔹 Ethical Use & Awareness**

- **Ethical Use:** Testing, research, parental monitoring, and corporate security compliance  
- **Unethical Use:** Spying, stealing information, or unauthorized surveillance  

> ⚠️ Unethical use is illegal and punishable by law.  
> This project is strictly for educational purposes to understand both attacker strategies and defensive techniques.
